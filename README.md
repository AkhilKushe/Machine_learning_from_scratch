# Machine Learning From Scratch

Implementation of simple machine learning algorithms from 
scratch using python in 2D

This exercise helped me understand gradient descent and how to implement it in a simple way.

- Support Vector Machine (Supervised)
- K-mean Cluster (Unsupervised ML)
- FeedForward NeuralNetrowk (Supervised)


## Python modules used
- Scipy
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- scikit learn
- pandas
